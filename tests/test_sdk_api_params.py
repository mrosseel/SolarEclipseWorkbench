"""XSDK_SetProp and XSDK_GetProp take an api_param, and it is not free-form.

Every call site in the wrapper passed 0 by hand.  The SDK's own headers list
one required number per API per model, and 25 of our 28 calls disagreed with
the X-T4's, so the body answered 0x1002 "Invalid parameter" - which is why the
focus mode was unreadable and the live view size unsettable.

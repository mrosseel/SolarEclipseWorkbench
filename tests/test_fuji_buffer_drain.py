"""Draining the volatile buffer, where a miscount is invisible until it bites.

Every frame shot with an SDK session open holds one of 32 slots until it is
drained, and a full buffer stops the body dead mid-eclipse.  The count the drain
works from is therefore the only thing standing between a bracket and a body
that needs its battery pulled.

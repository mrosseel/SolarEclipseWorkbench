"""Serial port enumeration, with the platform differences handled once.

macOS exposes each USB serial adapter twice: as ``/dev/tty.usbserial-X`` and as
``/dev/cu.usbserial-X``.  They are not interchangeable.  Opening the ``tty``
node blocks until it sees carrier detect, which a relay board or a mount
controller never asserts, so the open hangs or times out.  The ``cu`` node
("call-up") does not wait, and is the one to use for anything that is not a
modem.

Enumerating both would also make every device appear twice in the bench
console's scan, and half of those entries would hang if selected.

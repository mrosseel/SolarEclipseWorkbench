"""Mount driver registry.

Drivers are discovered from two places:

    - modules shipped inside this package, imported on first use
    - the ``solareclipseworkbench.mount_drivers`` entry point group, so a driver
      can live in its own installable package without being vendored here

Writing a driver:

    from solareclipseworkbench.mounts import MountDriver, register_driver

    @register_driver
    class MyMount(MountDriver):
        name = "mymount"
        display_name = "My Mount"
        def connect(self): ...
        def close(self): ...
        def describe(self): ...
        def status(self): ...
        def get_radec(self): ...
        def goto(self, ra_hours, dec_degrees, wait=False, timeout=180.0): ...
        def abort(self): ...
        def tracking_on(self): ...
        def tracking_off(self): ...

Anything the mount cannot do is left alone: the base class raises
:class:`MountNotSupported`, and :attr:`MountDriver.capabilities` tells callers
in advance rather than making them try and catch.

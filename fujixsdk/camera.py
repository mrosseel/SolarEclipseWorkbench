#   8 at 1/4000 - the 80 ms contact bounds it, not the shutter speed)

#   sooner - and a bracket reads 0.35s after the tap - and it shows none of them

# So a reading may understate by a whole tap (3), and one more tap fires before
# the next reading (3): true occupancy can be 6 above what the check saw, which

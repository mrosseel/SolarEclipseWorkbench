"""Get a busy body back to a state where it will take commands.

"Camera is busy" is not one condition.  The body reports it for a half-pressed
shutter, an exposure in progress, a running live view and an untransferred
image alike, and the remedy differs for each: stopping a live view is free and
instant, while firing a shot to flush the pipeline costs a shutter actuation
and cannot clear a live view at all.  Treating them as one thing is how a body
still streaming from a crashed process came to be diagnosed as dead hardware
needing a power cycle, repeatedly, on 4 August 2026.

So this asks first.  XSDK_GetErrorDetails names the blockers in a bitmask, and
the remedies here are ordered by what they cost: read, then stop, then cancel,
then drain, then force, and only last fire a shot.  Each step is skipped when
the body does not report the thing it fixes.

Used on session open, before live view starts, and when a scheduled command
comes back busy - anywhere the answer to "why won't it" was previously a guess.
